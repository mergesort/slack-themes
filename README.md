# What is this?

Some Slack themes that I use. I think they're pretty, you don't have to, but you can use them if you like.

----

## How do I use them?

Great question!

Below every preview image is a series of hex values. To add the theme to your Slack, open your team, open preferences [as demonstrated below](), and pick `Sidebar Theme` option. You should see a button that says `Feeling adventurous? You can customize your theme and share it with others.` You can paste the hex values in there, and voila, you have a custom theme.

##So without further ado, themes!
